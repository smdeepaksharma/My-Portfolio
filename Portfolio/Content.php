$about ="Even in an age when coding is slated to be the new literacy, pages of  source code will still be gibberish to most laymen who are not connected to the programming world. How much power and potential lie hidden in them! Personally, they make my day come alive and are the highest inspirations that have come to me without me seeking them, and there is no other region I want to inhabit.
The rapid and unstoppable proliferation of technology led me to choose Information Science and Engineering as my undergraduate major. In the very first year computer concepts were introduced and although I initially grappled with some of the concepts in 'C Programming', the extensive amount of practical work I did to master the most complicated principles and repeated experimentation with theory in the labs, led to increasing command over the language. Programming became a secret delight to which I had to return compulsively at every opportune juncture. While all lab courses proved high scorers, languages such as C++, JAVA, C# and .NET set my imagination on fire. I spent long hours perfecting technique, practicing concepts, solving new problems, designing and developing programs for new set requirements.
Analysis and Design of algorithms subject was one of my favourites. I received high appreciation from my lecturer for being able to solve and execute the Travelling Sales Men problem reputed to be the toughest to crack at the students level in the external lab exam. My score of 85/100 was the highest, and I also did well in Formal Languages and Automata Theory, Compiler Design, Graph theory, with logical thinking, mathematical abilities and problem solving skills being my forte. The scores reflected my passion and hard work.
Whenever I came across a new software application, my mind would be alert and agile and start examining the central concept, source codes, and design that enabled realisation of the initial vision. I began to study the Whatsapp messenger app and Facebook networking service from the perspective of programming and large amounts of data being handled. I began to ruminate on the dynamic environments that would have given rise to the source codes and the thousands of applications that would have been integrated to make such phenomenal developments possible.
These lines of thought led more interest in data management systems and through the subject DBMS, I gathered perfunctory knowledge. My pre final year project Transaction Management System was a simple data management project through which I gained some practical knowledge. Later I added subject strengths through reading and referencing, and also attended a training program on Big Data Analytics conducted by STATLABS at SJB Research Foundation. There I was introduced to data management tools that are specially designed to manage large amounts of data and learnt how such data can be used to perform analytics. The workshop not only enhanced my interest in the technologies but also gave me the confidence to complete the DBMS modules in my final year project Optimized Energy Consumption using Cross Layer Functioning in Wireless sensor Networks to perfection, working efficiently with MySQL.
